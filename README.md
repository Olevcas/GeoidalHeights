# Calculations of Geoidal Heights

In this project, I attempt to calculate the geoidal heights in different points, by using gravimetric models and measurements.

## Setting up the virtual enviroment on mac

Head to the root folder of the project:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/my_project
```
Create the virtual enviroment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the enviroment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

##Recommended python version

For this project, I used Python 3.11.3 in my virtual enviroment. I am not exactly sure how different python versions will affect the program, but I recommend using the same version as mine.

## Creating the requirements.txt

After entering the venv, type this command to create or update the text file containing the current packages installed in the venv:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Installing the dependencies

When the user is inside the venv and wants to install the dependencies for the project, use this command: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## What is __pycache__?

These files are automatically generated by Python to store compiled bytecode files (.pyc) for modules that are imported. These bytecode files help speed up the loading of modules. They do not need to be changed even though they're a bit annoying.


## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
